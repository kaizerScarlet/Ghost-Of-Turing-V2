Legacy Prototype - MT5 infrastructure (Deprecated)
This was  the first working version of Ghost of Turing, initially called (JOAT), JACK OF ALL TRADES; built using Metatrader 5 for order execution, and risk management

Now migrated to a custom engine using a new stack, but this project shows early testing of 
* Basic Order Flow mechanics
* SL/TP dynamics
* Basic ML model
* Basic ARIMA Model

Infrastructure is now deprecated, but logic and components inspired the next gen version.
I have attached the performance of this strategy as an HTML file, though it still has unrefined quirks such as over leveraging which will be be addressed in the next model.
Also need to ensure that it connects to an exchange directly rather than a broker.
