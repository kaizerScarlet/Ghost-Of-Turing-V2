Legacy Prototype - MT5 infrastructure (Deprecated)
This was  the first working version of Ghost of Turing, initially called (JOAT), JACK OF ALL TRADES; built using Metatrader 5 for order execution, and risk management

Now migrated to a custom engine using a new stack, but this project shows early testing of 
* Basic Order Flow mechanics
* SL/TP dynamics
* Basic ML model
* Basic ARIMA Model

Infrastructure is now deprecated, but logic and components inspired the next gen version.
